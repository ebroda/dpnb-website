The second MVP workshop dealt with topics such as manufacturing preferences, capacity planning and quality metrics,
but also software architecture and the description of the individual tasks of the broker.
On the basis of these topics, the joint vision of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was sharpened and concrete working points were defined
for the individual work packages. The very good discussions showed the complexity of the questions.
In the MVP we want to try to solve them as minimalistically and goal-oriented as possible.
The experience gained is also incorporated into the more in-depth work of the work packages.
