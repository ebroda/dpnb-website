On May 7th, representatives of all project partners of the DPNB consortium met at the Forschungszentrum Informatik (FZI) in Karlsruhe for a workshop on "Framework conditions and Use Case 0". Methodical solutions were collected in groups. These were then discussed and substantiated by all participants in the form of an open discussion. It became clear that the project has made huge leaps in the last weeks and that we can already look forward to the next months. Something big is emerging!
